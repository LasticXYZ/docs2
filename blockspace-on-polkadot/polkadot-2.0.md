# üßê Polkadot 2.0

* Give a little intro to Polkadot.

&#x20;   \- multichain ecosystem, one relay chain

&#x20;   \- think about cores as processors that allow for parachains to be included on the relay chain

&#x20;   \- in the past people have been buying these processors in a very rigid fashion. You were able to buy a core for a duration of 24 months, with crowdfunding mechanisms. Where people would raise money in order to buy a core.

### Polkadot 2.0 and what it brings to the table

With the introduction of Polkadot 2.0 the blockspace as a concept has become much more flexible, anybody not just individual projects can buy a core.
